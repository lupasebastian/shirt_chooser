# shirt_chooser
Shirt Chooser is a tool designed to help people decide what they should wear in the morning.
The tool lets user decide what color of shirt they should wear and if they want marks and texts on their shirt.
Then it proceeds to, basing on primary choices, get random color and/or mark and/or text on the shirt.
First draft requires every user to have exactly the same wardrobe which may be a little inconvenient.
Further releases will enable every user to configure their own wardrobe as a source of choices.

I hope you will all have fun using this powerful application.
